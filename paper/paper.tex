\section*{Introduction}
Nonlinear prediciton using S-maps and simplex projection are by now an
establised set of techniques used for analyzing natural systems.


We introduce a measure of prediction uncertainty for the S-map. We are
given one or several time series which we use to reconstruct an $E$
dimensional attractor. Denote the state on the attractor
$\mathbf{x}^{(t)} = (x_1^{(t)},...,x_E^{(t)})$ with $t=1,...,T$. In
the univariate case we take time lags of the same time series, so
$\mathbf{(t)} = (x^{(t)},...,x^{(t-E+1)})$. For every $t$, we are also
given an observation $y^{(t)}$. Note that in many cases, we may want
to predict the time evolution of (say) the first coordinate and then
$y^{(t)} := x_1^{(t-1)}$. The S-map prediction for a new $\mathbf{x}$
with a given nonlinearity parameter $\theta$ is found by first solving
the (local) least squares problem for $\beta$:
\begin{equation}
  \beta := \arg \min_{\hat{\beta}} \|W(X \hat{\beta} - \mathbf{y}) \|_2^2,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation*}
  X =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    -& -& -& \mathbf{x}^{(1)} & - & - & - \\
     &  &  &  \vdots         &   &   &   \\
    -& -& -& \mathbf{x}^{(T)} & - & - & - \\    
  \end{bmatrix},
  \mathbf{y} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    y^{(1)} \\
    \vdots \\
    y^{(T)}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \text{ and } W := diag( w_1,...,w_T), w_t: =\exp( -\theta \| \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}^{(t)}\| )
\end{equation*}
Given $\beta$, we predict $y = \beta' \mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^E
\beta_i x_i$. The novel uncertainty measure we intruduce is simply
defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:uncertainty}
  \text{Uncertainty}(\mathbf{x}) := \sum_{t=1}^T w_t (y - y^{(t)})^2
  \bigg / \sum_{t=1}^T w_t = \sum_{t=1}^T w_t (\beta' \mathbf{x} -
  y^{(t)})^2 \bigg / \sum_{t=1}^T w_t.
\end{equation}
This is in contrast to the similar \emph{fitting error} that we found
insufficient
\begin{equation*}
\text{Fitting Error}(\mathbf{x}) := \sum_{t=1}^T w_t ( \beta'
\mathbf{x}^{(t)} - y^{(t)})^2 \bigg / \sum_{t=1}^T w_t.
\end{equation*}
The former represents the divergence in trajectories of the time
series, whereas the latter merely represents a fitting error, hence
underestimating the prediction uncertainty associated with
$\mathbf{x}$.

\section*{Results}
Using the uncertainty measure described in \eqref{eq:uncertainty} we
approach the problem of predicting Chlorophyll abundance (denoted Chl)
in the waters of southern California. For a thorough introduction, see
\cite{that paper}. It was found that six variables are causally
related to the dynamics of Chl. We consider models that contain the
Chl data at the time of observation, denoted Chl(t) and three other
variables that may or may not be lagged. We take lags of one or two
weeks so we have $6 \cdot 3 + 2 = 20$ variables to choose --- lags of
0,1, or 2 weeks for the environmental variables plus lag of 1 or 2
weeks Chl. Since the embedding dimension was found to be $E=4$, we
have $\binom{20}{3} = 1140$ possible models to choose from. For each
prediction time, we can choose a fraction of the least uncertain (most
confident) models to predict and average these predictions.
